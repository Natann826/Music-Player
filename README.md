# Music-Player
I got fed up using YouTube as a music player so I decided to make one for myself.

Some features:

- assures that only one song is playing at a time, with identifiers like changing the <title> of the page to the song
- "clipping" where you can highlight a certain great part of a song and put it into its own "clip" section
- auto play, where on ending a song it will progress to the next one in line. can also press "l" to disable this and have every song loop.
- youtube-dl implemented in the page for easy downloading songs
